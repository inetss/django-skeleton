# Development workflow

Currently there is no acceptance protocol. Everything that is pushed to `master` goes to production. All other branches are for your personal use.

## Git branches

* `master` is automatically deployed to <https://acme.com> (see [Deployment workflow](../deployment/workflow.md) for details).
